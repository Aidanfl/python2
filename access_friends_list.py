# This script demonstrates how to access elements in a list.
# It creates a list of friends and attempts to print the friend at index 4.
# The code has been corrected to access a valid index (3) to avoid an IndexError.

friends = ['Joseph', 'Glenn', 'Sally', 'Chase']
print(friends[3])  # This will print 'Chase', which is the last element in the list.
