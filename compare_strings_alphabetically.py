# This script compares two strings ("banana" and "bb") using the greater than operator.
# It demonstrates how string comparison works in Python by comparing characters left to right in alphabetical order.
# Since "b" in "banana" equals "b" in "bb", the comparison moves to the second characters, where "a" is less than "b",
# resulting in "bb" being considered greater than "banana".

print("banana" > "bb")
#shows "bb" > "banana" because of "bb" vs "ba"
# it goes left to right and alphabetical order
