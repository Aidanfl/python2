# This script demonstrates a TypeError caused by attempting to concatenate an integer with a string.
# The variable phoneNumber initially contains an integer (234-5678), which results in an error when concatenated with a string.
# The correction is to store the phone number as a string: phoneNumber = "234-5678".

phoneNumber = 234-5678  
print("My phone number is " + phoneNumber) 
# error: TypeError: can only concentrate str (not "int") to str
# correction: phoneNumber = "234-5678"
