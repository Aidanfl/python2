# This script demonstrates how to replace a character in a string.
# It starts with the string 'word' set to "sky" and replaces the character at index 2 with 'i'.
# A new string is created, and the result is printed.

word = "sky"
word = word[:2] + 'i'  # Replace the character at index 2
print(word)
